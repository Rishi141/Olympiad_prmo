\item Rama was asked by her teacher to subtract 3 from a certain number and then divide the result by 9. Instead, she subtracted 9 and then divided the result by 3. She got 43 as the answer. What would have been her answer if she had solved the problem correctly?

\item A triangle with perimeter 7 has integer side lengths. What is the maximum possible area of such a triangle ?

\item The letters R, M and O represent whole numbers. If $R \times M \times O = 240$, $R \times O + M = 46$, 
$R + O \times M = 64$, What is the value of R + M + O?

\item A postman has to deliver five letters to five different houses. Mischievously, he posts one letter through each door without looking to see if it is the correct address. In how many different ways could he do this so that exactly two of the five houses receive the correct letters ?

\item If 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2011 + \sqrt{2011^2 - 1}}} = \sqrt{m} - \sqrt{n}
\end{align*}
where m and n are positive integers, what is the value of m + n?

\item How many non-negative integral values of x satisfy the equation $[\frac{x}{5}] = [\frac{x}{7}]$ ? (Here [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. For example [3.4] = 3 and [-2.3] = -3.)

\item Let N be the set of natural numbers. Suppose $f: N \to {N}$ is a function satisfying the following conditions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item f(m, n) = f(m)f(n);
\item $f(m) < f(n)$ if $m < n$;
\item f(2) = 2. What is the value of $\sum_{k = 1}^{20}$ f(k)?
\end{enumerate}
