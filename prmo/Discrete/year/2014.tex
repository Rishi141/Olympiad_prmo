\item In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second side, and the length of the third side is 17. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle? 

\item Let S be a set of real numbers with mean M. If the means of the sets $S \cup \{15\}$ and $S \cup \{15,1\}$ are M+2 and M + 1, respectively, then how many elements does S have?

\item For how many natural numbers n between 1 and 2014 (both inclusive) is $\frac{8n}{9999-n}$ an integer?

\item One morning, each member of Manjul's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk. The amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Manjul drank $(\frac{1}{7})^{th}$ of the total amount of milk and 
$(\frac{2}{17})^{th}$ of the total amount of coffee. How many people are there in Manjul's family?

\item Let f be a one-to-one function from the set of natural numbers to itself such that f(mn) = f(m)f(n) for all natural numbers m and n. What is the least possible value of f(999)?

\item Let 
\begin{align*}
x_{1}, x_{2},....,x_{2014}
\end{align*}
