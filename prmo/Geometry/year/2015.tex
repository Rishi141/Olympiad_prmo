\item In rectangle ABCD, AB = 8 and BC = 20. Let P be a point on AD such that $\angle BPC = 90^{o}$. If $r_1$, $r_2$, $r_3$ are the radii of the incircles of triangles APB, BPC and CPD, what is the value of $r_1 + r_2 + r_3$?

\item In acute-angled triangle ABC, let D be the foot of the altitude from A, and E be the midpoint of BC. Let F be the midpoint of AC. Suppose $\angle BAE = 40^{o}$. If $\angle DAE = \angle DFE$, what is the magnitude of $\angle ADF$ in degrees?

\item The circle $\omega$ touches the circle $\Omega$ internally at P. The centre O of $\Omega$ is outside $\omega$. Let XY be a diameter of $\Omega$ which is also tangent to $\omega$. Assume $PY > PX$. Let PY intersect $\omega$ at Z. If YZ = 2PZ, what is the magnitude of $\angle PYX$ in degrees?
