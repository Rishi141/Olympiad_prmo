\item Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals. If AB = 20, BC = 70 and CD = 90, then what is the value of DA?

\item In a triangle ABC, X and Y are points on the segments AB and AC, respectively, such that AX : XB = 1 : 2 and AY : YC = 2 : 1. If the area triangle AXY is 10 then what is the area of triangle ABC?

\item Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with $\angle DAB = \angle BDC = 90$. Let the incircles of triangles ABD and BCD touch BD at P and Q, respectively, with P lying in between B and Q. If AD = 999 and PQ = 200 then what is the sum of the radii of the incircles of triangles ABD and BDC? 

\item Let XOY be a triangle with $\angle XOY = 90^0$. Let M and  N be the midpoints of legs OX and OY, respectively. Suppose that XN = 19 and YM = 22. What is  XY?

\item In a triangle ABC, let I denote the incenter. Let the lines AI, BI and CI intersect the incircle at P, Q and R, respectively. If $\angle BAC = 40^{o}$, what is the value of $\angle QPR$ in degrees?
