\item There are eight rooms on the first floor of a hotel, with four rooms on each side of the corridor. Symmetrically situated. Four guests have to be accommodated in four of the eight rooms such that no two guests are in adjacent rooms or in opposite rooms. In how many ways can the guests be accommodated?

\item How many positive integers less than 1000 have the property that the sum of the digits of each such number is divisible by 7 and the number itself is divisible by 3?

\item A contractor has two teams of workers: team A and team B. Team A can complete a job in 12 days and Team B can do the same job in 36 days. Team A starts working on the job and Team B joins team A after 4 days. The team A withdraws after two more days. For how many more days should team B work to complete the job?

\item A pen costs $11/-$ and a notebook costs $13/-$. Find the number of ways in which a person can spend exactly $1000/-$ to buy pens and notebooks.

\item There are five cities A, B, C, D, E on a certain island. Each city is connected to every other city by road. In how many ways can a person starting from city A come back to A after visiting some cities without visiting a city more than once and without taking the same road more than once?(The order in which he visits the cities also matters: e.g, the routes $A \to B \to C \to A$ and $A \to C \to B \to A$ are different.)

\item Let 
\begin{align*}
f(x) = \sin \frac{x}{3} + \cos \frac{3x}{10}
